# Etch a Sketch

This project is related to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The objetive was to implement a simple Etch a Sketch with different functionalities to change the color of the squares that compose a grid.

The programs allows to:

1. Pick a custom color
2. Generate random colors
3. Erase the previus colors
4. Increment the darkness of the squares by 10%
5. Change the number of squares in the grid using a slider

All this was achieved only with native DOM manipulation. 

The UI is not good at all and is defenitively not responsive because of the fact that simulate the hover effect with touch eventes is not that easy (see the issue about adding hover to mobile devices).

Here is the live [demo](https://fgfrutos.github.io/Etch_a_sketch/) of this project.
